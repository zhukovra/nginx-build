# NGINX Build Script

This is an NGINX build script which compiles NGINX with a custom version of OpenSSL. It should work on other Debian-based Linux distros.

The benefit of building from source is you can customize the modules to your needs and always use the latest versions of NGINX and OpenSSL.

Compiling will take time, especially on a Raspberry Pi, so be patient.

### Additional modules for Nginx:

* [MaxMind GeoIP2 module](https://github.com/leev/ngx_http_geoip2_module)

## Acknowledgments

The script was originally based on the [build_nginx.sh](https://gist.github.com/MattWilcox/402e2e8aa2e1c132ee24) script from [@MattWilcox](https://github.com/MattWilcox), but revised overtime to better fit my needs. You can find more details about the other Matt's version in his [blog post](https://mattwilcox.net/web-development/setting-up-a-secure-website-with-https-and-spdy-support-under-nginx-on-a-raspberry-pi).
